Based on the “\+Exploited Weakness to Deny Service” the dos attacks can be either Brute-\/force or semantic. Brute-\/force attacks are performed by initiating a vast amount of seemingly legitimate transactions. A high number of attack packets exhausts the victim’s resources. Meanwhile, Semantic attacks exploit a specific feature or implementation bug of some protocol or application installed at the victim in order to consume excess amounts of its resources. Brute-\/force attacks are usually detected by sophisticated network-\/layer protection mechanisms and our concern is the detection and prevention of CPU-\/exhaustive semantic attacks. CODAX models the CPU time consumed by legitimate connections within the application. When a new connection is established, CODAX monitors the CPU time consumed by this connection and detects attacks through statistical methods. Once an attack has been detected the Action module will be triggered to prevent the system from crashing.
